# Gross Economy

A status bar mod for Planetary Annihilation that emphasises income and expense so that they can be visually compared.  The net amount of each resource is also expressed in "basic fabbers" that could be started or stopped to balance the economy.

Partially compatible with Economic Efficiency - the additional center box will remain if both are enabled.
